#  PES ASIC CLASS
# About the repository 

Welcome to my GitHub repository dedicated to VLSI Physical Design for ASICs using open-source tools! Here, we embark on a journey that starts with processor specifications and leverages the power of the RISC-V ISA. We'll build processors from scratch, taking them through the entire RTL to GDS process  that meets various Performance, Power, Area ( PPA ) and manufacturability requirements. The best part? We're doing it all with open-source tools, including the RISC-V toolchain and OpenLane anad many more .

# Day 1: Introduction to RISC-V ISA and GNU Compiler Toolchain




## Overview from Application to Hardware

- **Apps**: Application software, often referred to as "apps," performs specific tasks or functions for end-users.

- **System Software**: This category acts as an intermediary between hardware components and user-facing applications. It provides essential services, manages resources, and enables application execution.

- **Operating System**: The fundamental software managing hardware resources and offering services for users and applications. It controls memory, processes, files, and interfaces (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux, Android).

- **Compiler**: Translates high-level programming code( C ,C++ , java etc... ) into assembly-level language.

- **Assembler**: Converts assembly language code into machine code ( 10101011100 ) for direct processor execution. 

- **RTL (Register Transfer Level)**: Represents digital circuit behavior using registers and data transfer operations.

- **Hardware**: Physical components of a computer system or electronic device enabling various tasks.






## Introduction to RISC-V :
### RISC-V Archiecture 

RISC-V is an **open-source Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)** that has gained significant attention and adoption in computer architecture and semiconductor design. RISC architectures simplify instruction sets by focusing on a smaller set of instructions, each executable in a single clock cycle, leading to faster instruction execution.

### RISC-V Instruction Types

- **R-Type**: Register-type instructions, involving operations between registers. Example: `add`, `and`, `or`.

- **I-Type**: Immediate-type instructions, using immediate values for operations. Example: `addi`, `ori`, `lw`.

- **S-Type**: Store-type instructions, storing data from a register to memory. Example: `sw`, `sb`.

- **B-Type**: Branch-type instructions, conditional branching based on comparisons. Example: `beq`, `bne`, `blt`.

- **U-Type**: Upper immediate-type instructions, used for large immediate values. Example: `lui`, `auipc`.

- **J-Type**: Jump-type instructions, unconditional jumps within the program. Example: `jal`, `jalr`.
  
 In addition to base instruction there are more instruction which help in improving exceution speed like Pseudo Instructions (`li` and `mv`) , Multiply Extension Instructions (`mul`, `mulh`, `mulhu`, and `mulhsu`) , Single and Double Precision Floating Point Extension and so on 

## Labwork for RISC-V software tool chain : 
The main objective of this lab is to compile simple C codes using `gcc compiler`  and run them on native hardware. Similarly, the goal is to compile the same code using `riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc`, execute it on a RISC-V core within a simulator, and understand the process involved. The ultimate goal is to ensure that any high-level program written can be successfully executed on our hardware platform.


A simple c code to find sum from 1 to N : 
```
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
	int sum=0 , n=5;
	for (int i=0;i<=n;++i)
	{
		sum = sum+i;
	}
	printf("The sum of numbers from 1 to %d is %d\n",n,sum);
	return 0;
}
```
execution command : 
```
gcc sum_1_n.c -o sum_1_n.o
./sum_1_n.o
```


compile the same using riscv compiler and view the output


```
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O1 -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum_obj.o sum_1_n.c
spike pk sum_obj.o
```



Additional info :
- `-O1`: This flag sets the optimization level to low. It balances code size and execution speed while maintaining reasonable compilation times.

- `-mabi=lp64`: This flag defines the ABI (Application Binary Interface) with 64-bit pointers and long integers. It's a common choice for 64-bit RISC-V systems.

- `-march=rv64i`: This flag specifies the target architecture as the base integer-only RISC-V architecture for 64-bit systems. It focuses on the fundamental integer instructions.



TO see the RISC-V disassembled code : 
```
riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d sum_obj.o

```
To disassemble the object file and view its contents, use the following command:
```
riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d sum_obj.o | less 
```
To navigate through `less` use : 
+ Press /instance to search for a specific instance.
+ Press ENTER to begin the search.
+ To find the next occurrence, press n.
+ To search for the previous occurrence, press N.
+ To exit the less viewer, press esc, type :q, and then press ENTER.

-O1 optimised main 

here we see that we have 15 line of code in main

Now let us compile the code use `-Ofast` and see the line of exceution  
```
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -Ofast -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum_obj.o sum_1_n.c
```
-Ofast optimised main 


here we can see that the code is executed in only 12 lines , which is due to the optimisation we applied 



### Running the Assembly code on simulator in debug mode :
```
spike -d pk sum_obj.o
```

## Integer number representation :
### Unsigned Numbers
Unsigned numbers, also known as non-negative numbers, are numerical values that represent magnitudes without indicating direction or sign.
**Range :** [0, (2^n)-1 ]
### Signed Numbers
Signed numbers are numerical values that can represent both positive and negative magnitudes, along with zero.
**Range :** Positive : [0 , 2^(n-1)-1] Negative : [-1 to 2^(n-1)]

## LAB for signed and unsigned integer type 

let us run this C code to determine the range of integer type supported by RISC-V 
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int main () {
	long long int max = (long long int) (pow ( 2, 63) -1);
	long long int min = (long long int) (pow ( 2, 63)* (-1));
	printf("highest number represented by long long int is %lld\n", max);
	printf("lowest number represented by long long int is %lld\n", min );
	return 0;
}
```

we can play around with different values , datatype to find their respect max and min values
